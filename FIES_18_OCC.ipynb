    "# Preparation and Cleaning of the FIES & LFS 2018 Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a comprehensive workflow for preparing and cleaning the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) and Labor Force Survey (LFS) 2018 dataset, focusing on Region 13. The process includes data loading, merging, filtering, cleaning, variable transformation, indicator construction, and saving the final dataset for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading**\n",
    "    - Import necessary libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `os`, `importlib`).\n",
    "    - Load individual-level and household-level CSVs into DataFrames.\n",
    "    - Load external poverty indicator data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Merging**\n",
    "    - Merge individual and household DataFrames on shared keys (`W_REGN`, `W_PROV`, `SEQUENCE_NO`).\n",
    "    - Filter merged data for Region 13 (`W_REGN == 13`).\n",
    "    - Merge poverty indicators into the filtered dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Variable Cleaning and Transformation**\n",
    "    - Clean proxy variables: convert types, handle missing values, remove leading zeros, and standardize formats.\n",
    "    - Recode education levels using a custom function for consistent categories.\n",
    "    - Contextually fill missing values for key variables based on age and other conditions.\n",
    "    - Map categorical codes to descriptive labels using a mapping dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Indicator Construction**\n",
    "    - Create household-level indicators by aggregating individual data:\n",
    "        - Education buckets\n",
    "        - Age buckets\n",
    "        - Occupation codes\n",
    "        - Worker counts\n",
    "    - Generate dummy variables for categorical columns (e.g., domestic helper status).\n",
    "    - Extract household head sex and marital status.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final DataFrame Refinement**\n",
    "    - Remove unnecessary columns and duplicates.\n",
    "    - Merge household-level indicators.\n",
    "    - Convert selected columns to categorical types for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Saving the Cleaned Dataset**\n",
    "    - Save the final, cleaned, and labeled DataFrame (`df_18`) to disk for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cleaned DataFrame (`df_18`)**: Contains merged, filtered, and labeled data for Region 13, with household and individual indicators.\n",
    "- **CSV File**: Saved to `output/df_18_ols_occ.csv` for downstream analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook ensures that the FIES & LFS 2018 data is:\n",
    "- Consistently formatted and labeled\n",
    "- Ready for robust socioeconomic analysis\n",
    "- Documented for reproducibility and transparency"
