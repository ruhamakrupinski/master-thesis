    "# Preparation and Cleaning of the FIES & LFS 2021 Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents the workflow for preparing and cleaning the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) and Labor Force Survey (LFS) 2021 dataset, focusing on Region 13. The steps include data loading, merging, filtering, cleaning, variable transformation, indicator construction, and saving the final dataset for analysis.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading**\n",
    "    - Import libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `importlib`, `os`).\n",
    "    - Load individual-level and household-level CSVs.\n",
    "    - Load external poverty indicator data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Merging**\n",
    "    - Merge individual and household DataFrames on shared keys (`W_REGN`, `W_PROV`, `SEQUENCE_NO`).\n",
    "    - Filter for Region 13 (`W_REGN == 13`).\n",
    "    - Merge poverty indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Variable Cleaning and Transformation**\n",
    "    - Clean proxy variables: convert types, handle missing values, remove leading zeros, and standardize formats.\n",
    "    - Recode education levels using a custom function.\n",
    "    - Fill missing values contextually based on age and other conditions.\n",
    "    - Map categorical codes to descriptive labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Indicator Construction**\n",
    "    - Construct household-level and individual-level indicators (education buckets, age buckets, occupation codes, worker counts).\n",
    "    - Create indicators for domestic helpers and household head characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final DataFrame Refinement**\n",
    "    - Remove individual-level columns and unnecessary variables.\n",
    "    - Merge household-level indicators.\n",
    "    - Convert selected columns to categorical types.\n",
    "    - Remove duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Saving the Cleaned Dataset**\n",
    "    - Save the final DataFrame (`df_21`) as a CSV file for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cleaned DataFrame (`df_21`)**: Merged, filtered, and labeled data for Region 13, with household and individual indicators.\n",
    "- **CSV File**: Saved for downstream analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook ensures the FIES & LFS 2021 data is:\n",
    "- Consistently formatted and labeled\n",
    "- Ready for socioeconomic analysis\n",
    "- Documented for reproducibility and transparency\n"
